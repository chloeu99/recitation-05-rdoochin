- **3)**

Since we don't use scan in our get_position function, and its most complex operation is a for loop, our runtime simplifies to O(n). The function isn't very parallelizable however, so the span is the same, S(n).

- **5)**
The work is O(n).
The Span is O(n).


- **6)**
The work is O(n) because all of the functions used in supersort have a work of O(n).
The span is O(log^2(n)), we get this from adding O(logn) + O(n) +O(n).



- **8)**
The work is O(nlogn) and the span is O(log^2(n)).
